# Service Layer Refactoring Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring effort to implement a service layer architecture across the InvoicePlane application, separating business logic from models and controllers.

## Objectives Achieved

### 1. Service Layer Architecture Implemented
- ✅ Created service layer pattern for business logic separation
- ✅ Implemented dependency injection for service composition
- ✅ Established clear responsibilities: Models (data), Services (logic), Controllers (HTTP)

### 2. Quotes Module - Complete Refactoring (Prototype)
All 5 models in the Quotes module have been refactored:

| Component | Lines Before | Lines After | Reduction | Methods Moved to Service |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Quote | 571 | 178 | -69% | 17 static methods |
| QuoteAmount | 447 | 73 | -84% | 6 static methods |
| QuoteItem | 213 | 116 | -46% | 4 static methods |
| QuoteItemAmount | 141 | 73 | -48% | 1 static method |
| QuoteTaxRate | 124 | 68 | -45% | 2 static methods |
| **TOTAL** | **1,496** | **508** | **-66%** | **30 methods** |

### 3. Services Created

#### QuoteService (16 methods)
- `getStatuses()` - Quote status definitions
- `getValidationRules()` - Validation rules for create
- `getSaveValidationRules()` - Validation rules for save
- `createQuote()` - Create quote with related records
- `copyQuote()` - Copy quote with items and taxes
- `deleteQuote()` - Delete quote and cleanup
- `calculateDateDue()` - Calculate expiry date
- `generateQuoteNumber()` - Generate quote number
- `generateUrlKey()` - Generate URL key
- `getInvoiceGroupId()` - Get invoice group
- `approveQuoteByKey()` - Approve by URL key
- `rejectQuoteByKey()` - Reject by URL key
- `approveQuoteById()` - Approve by ID
- `rejectQuoteById()` - Reject by ID
- `markViewed()` - Mark as viewed
- `markSent()` - Mark as sent
- `generateQuoteNumberIfApplicable()` - Conditional number generation

#### QuoteAmountService (6 methods)
Dependencies: QuoteService
- `calculate()` - Main calculation engine for quote amounts
- `calculateDiscount()` - Legacy mode discount calculation
- `getGlobalDiscount()` - Get global discount amount
- `calculateQuoteTaxes()` - Calculate quote-level taxes
- `getTotalQuoted()` - Get totals by period
- `getStatusTotals()` - Get status totals by period

#### QuoteItemService (4 methods)
Dependencies: QuoteAmountService, QuoteItemAmountService
- `getValidationRules()` - Item validation rules
- `saveItem()` - Save item with calculations
- `deleteItem()` - Delete item with recalculations
- `getItemsSubtotal()` - Get items subtotal

#### QuoteItemAmountService (1 method)
- `calculate()` - Calculate item amounts with legacy/new modes

#### QuoteTaxRateService (2 methods)
Dependencies: QuoteAmountService
- `getValidationRules()` - Tax rate validation rules
- `saveTaxRate()` - Save tax rate (legacy mode only)

### 4. Models Refactored

Models now contain ONLY:
- **Properties**: `$table`, `$primaryKey`, `$timestamps`, `$fillable`, `$casts`
- **Relationships**: `belongsTo()`, `hasMany()`, `hasOne()`
- **Scopes**: `scopeDraft()`, `scopeByClient()`, etc.

Removed from Models:
- Static business logic methods
- Validation rules (moved to services)
- CRUD operations (moved to services)
- Complex calculations (moved to services)
- Status changes (moved to services)

### 5. Controllers Updated

**QuotesController** refactored to use services:
- Constructor injection of QuoteService and QuoteAmountService
- Removed `Model::query()` calls (7 instances)
- Replaced static method calls with service methods
- Methods updated: `status()`, `view()`, `delete()`, `generatePdf()`, `deleteQuoteTax()`, `recalculateAllQuotes()`

### 6. Documentation Updated

Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with:
- Complete Service Layer Architecture section
- Service pattern examples
- Model refactoring guidelines
- Controller best practices
- Dependency injection examples
- Do's and Don'ts for each layer

## Code Quality Improvements

### Before Refactoring
```php
// ❌ Business logic in model
class Quote extends BaseModel
{
    public static function statuses(): array { ... }
    public static function createQuote(array $data): self { ... }
    public static function deleteQuote(int $quoteId): ?bool { ... }
    // ... 17 static methods
}

// ❌ Direct model calls in controller
class QuotesController
{
    public function index()
    {
        $statuses = Quote::statuses();
        Quote::deleteQuote($id);
        QuoteAmount::calculate($id, $discount);
    }
}
```

### After Refactoring
```php
// ✅ Clean model - data only
class Quote extends BaseModel
{
    protected $fillable = [...];
    protected $casts = [...];
    
    public function client() { return $this->belongsTo(...); }
    public function items() { return $this->hasMany(...); }
    public function scopeDraft($query) { ... }
}

// ✅ Business logic in service
class QuoteService
{
    public function getStatuses(): array { ... }
    public function createQuote(array $data): Quote { ... }
    public function deleteQuote(int $quoteId): ?bool { ... }
}

// ✅ Controller uses services
class QuotesController
{
    public function __construct(
        QuoteService $quoteService,
        QuoteAmountService $quoteAmountService
    ) {
        $this->quoteService = $quoteService;
        $this->quoteAmountService = $quoteAmountService;
    }
    
    public function index()
    {
        $statuses = $this->quoteService->getStatuses();
        $this->quoteService->deleteQuote($id);
        $this->quoteAmountService->calculate($id, $discount);
    }
}
```

## Benefits Achieved

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Models**: Pure data structure and relationships
- **Services**: Isolated, testable business logic
- **Controllers**: HTTP handling and service orchestration

### 2. Testability
- Services can be unit tested in isolation
- Dependencies can be mocked easily
- No need to interact with database for service logic tests

### 3. Maintainability
- Business logic centralized in services
- Easier to locate and modify business rules
- Clear dependencies via constructor injection

### 4. Reusability
- Services can be used across multiple controllers
- Services can compose other services
- Reduces code duplication

### 5. Code Reduction
- 66% reduction in model code
- Removed 988 lines of business logic from models
- Models are now focused and readable

## Remaining Work

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **QuotesAjaxController** - Update to use all 5 Quotes services (20+ `::query()` calls)
2. **Unit Tests** - Create tests for all Quotes services
3. **Integration Tests** - Update controller tests to inject service mocks

### Module Rollout Plan

Apply the same pattern to remaining modules:

#### Products Module (Priority: High)
- 4 models: Product, Family, TaxRate, Unit
- 5 static methods identified
- Estimated: 6-8 hours

#### Payments Module (Priority: High)
- 3 models: Payment, PaymentMethod, PaymentLog
- 3 static methods identified
- Estimated: 4-6 hours

#### CRM Module (Priority: Medium)
- 5 models: Client, ClientNote, Project, Task, UserClient
- 5 static methods identified
- Estimated: 8-10 hours

#### Core Module (Priority: Medium)
- 14+ models: User, Session, Setting, CustomField, EmailTemplate, etc.
- 25 static methods identified
- Estimated: 15-20 hours

### Total Estimated Effort
- **Quotes Module**: ✅ Complete (16 hours)
- **Remaining Modules**: 33-44 hours
- **Testing**: 10-15 hours
- **Documentation**: 3-5 hours
- **TOTAL**: 62-80 hours

## Technical Debt Addressed

### Before
- Business logic scattered across models and controllers
- Static methods made testing difficult
- Tight coupling between layers
- Hard to reuse logic
- Models violated Single Responsibility Principle

### After
- Clear layer separation
- Dependency injection enables testing
- Loose coupling via interfaces/contracts (future)
- Services promote reuse
- Each class has single responsibility

## Conclusion

The Quotes module refactoring serves as a successful prototype for the service layer pattern. The approach:

1. ✅ **Reduces code** in models by 66%
2. ✅ **Improves testability** via dependency injection
3. ✅ **Enhances maintainability** through separation of concerns
4. ✅ **Promotes reusability** of business logic
5. ✅ **Documents pattern** for consistent application

The pattern is ready to be applied systematically across all remaining modules, with an estimated 60-80 hours of additional development effort.
