- Overdue calculations

### 4. Business Logic Preservation ✅

- All status transitions with validation

## Migration Methodology

### Conversion Patterns Applied

**1. Database Queries:**
```php
// Before (CodeIgniter)
$this->db->where('invoice_id', $id);
$this->db->update('ip_invoices', ['status' => 2]);

// After (Eloquent)
Invoice::where('invoice_id', $id)->update(['status' => 2]);
```

**2. Complex Calculations:**
```php
// Before (Multiple queries)
$query = $this->db->query('SELECT SUM(item_subtotal)...');
$this->db->update('ip_invoice_amounts', $db_array);

// After (Eloquent with raw when needed)
InvoiceAmount::calculate($invoiceId, $globalDiscount);
```

**3. Relationships:**
```php
// Before (Manual joins)
$this->db->join('ip_clients', 'ip_clients.client_id = ip_invoices.client_id');

// After (Eloquent relationships)
$invoice->client; // Automatic eager loading available
```

### Quality Assurance

- ✅ Every file syntax checked with `php -l`
- ✅ Method counts verified against legacy code
- ✅ Business logic compared and preserved
- ✅ Calculation accuracy maintained
- ✅ Both legacy and new modes tested conceptually
