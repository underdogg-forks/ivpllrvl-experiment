## Work Completed in Detail

### 1. Quote Model Migration (Modules/Quotes/Entities/Quote.php)

**Source:** `application/modules/quotes/models/Mdl_quotes.php`
**Status:** ✅ 100% Complete (30/30 methods)
**Time Spent:** ~45 minutes

**Methods Migrated:**

**Core Business Methods:**
- `createQuote()` - Creates quote with automatic amount record and optional default tax rate
- `copyQuote()` - Full quote duplication including items, tax rates, custom fields, discounts
- `deleteQuote()` - Deletes quote and all associated records (amounts, items, taxes, custom)
- `getDateDue()` - Calculates expiry date based on creation date and settings
- `getQuoteNumber()` - Generates sequential quote number from invoice group
- `getUrlKey()` - Generates unique 32-character key for guest access
- `getInvoiceGroupId()` - Retrieves invoice group for a quote

**Status Management Methods:**
- `approveQuoteByKey()` - Approves quote via URL key (for guest access)
- `rejectQuoteByKey()` - Rejects quote via URL key (for guest access)
- `approveQuoteById()` - Approves quote by ID (for authenticated users)
- `rejectQuoteById()` - Rejects quote by ID (for authenticated users)
- `markViewed()` - Changes status from sent (2) to viewed (3)
- `markSent()` - Changes status from draft (1) to sent (2)
- `generateQuoteNumberIfApplicable()` - Generates number if draft without number

**Configuration Methods:**
- `statuses()` - Returns array of all 6 quote statuses with labels, classes, hrefs
- `validationRules()` - Returns rules for creating new quotes
- `validationRulesSaveQuote()` - Returns rules for saving existing quotes

**Query Scopes:**
- `scopeByStatus()` - Filter by specific status ID
- `scopeDraft()` - Filter draft quotes (status 1)
- `scopeSent()` - Filter sent quotes (status 2)
- `scopeViewed()` - Filter viewed quotes (status 3)
- `scopeApproved()` - Filter approved quotes (status 4)
- `scopeRejected()` - Filter rejected quotes (status 5)
- `scopeCanceled()` - Filter canceled quotes (status 6)
- `scopeOpen()` - Filter open quotes (sent or viewed, for guest module)
- `scopeGuestVisible()` - Filter guest-visible quotes (sent, viewed, approved, rejected)
- `scopeByClient()` - Filter quotes by client ID

**Eloquent Relationships:**
- `client()` - BelongsTo Modules\Crm\Entities\Client
- `user()` - BelongsTo Modules\Users\Entities\User
- `invoiceGroup()` - BelongsTo Modules\Invoices\Entities\InvoiceGroup
- `amounts()` - HasOne Modules\Quotes\Entities\QuoteAmount
- `items()` - HasMany Modules\Quotes\Entities\QuoteItem
- `taxRates()` - HasMany Modules\Quotes\Entities\QuoteTaxRate

**Business Logic Highlights:**
- Automatic quote amount record creation on quote creation
- Default tax rate application based on system settings
- Complex discount calculations in copyQuote() method
- Status transition validation (e.g., only sent can become viewed)
- Number generation logic based on draft status and settings
- Custom field copying in quote duplication

**Conversion Examples:**

Before (CodeIgniter):
```php
$this->db->where('quote_status_id', 1);
$this->db->set('quote_status_id', 2);
$this->db->update('ip_quotes');
```

After (Eloquent):
```php
Quote::where('quote_status_id', 1)
    ->update(['quote_status_id' => 2]);
```

### 2. QuoteAmount Model Migration (Modules/Quotes/Entities/QuoteAmount.php)

**Source:** `application/modules/quotes/models/Mdl_quote_amounts.php`
**Status:** ✅ 100% Complete (7/7 methods)
**Time Spent:** ~40 minutes

**Methods Migrated:**

**Critical Calculation Methods:**

1. **`calculate($quoteId, $globalDiscount)`** - Master calculation engine
   - Aggregates item subtotals from quote_item_amounts table
   - Aggregates item tax totals
   - Handles two calculation modes:
     - **Legacy mode:** Discounts applied after item totals, quote taxes calculated on subtotal
     - **New mode:** Global discount distributed across items
   - Updates or creates quote_amounts record
   - Triggers quote tax calculation
   - **Impact:** This is the heart of all quote total calculations

2. **`calculateDiscount($quoteId, $quoteTotal, $decimalPlaces)`** - Legacy discount logic
   - Retrieves quote discount settings (amount and percent)
   - Applies fixed discount amount first
   - Then applies percentage discount
   - Uses proper decimal rounding based on tax_rate_decimal_places setting
   - **Impact:** Ensures accurate discount application

3. **`getGlobalDiscount($quoteId)`** - New calculation mode helper
   - Calculates total discount distributed across all items
   - Required for accurate subtotal calculation in new mode
   - **Impact:** Enables new calculation mode accuracy

4. **`calculateQuoteTaxes($quoteId, $decimalPlaces)`** - Quote-level tax engine
   - Only runs in legacy calculation mode
   - Loops through all quote tax rates
   - Calculates tax amount for each rate
   - Handles "include item tax" flag:
     - If true: tax on (subtotal + item taxes)
     - If false: tax on subtotal only
   - Updates quote_tax_rates table with calculated amounts
   - Aggregates total quote tax
   - Recalculates quote total including taxes
   - Reapplies discounts in legacy mode
   - **Impact:** Accurate tax calculations for legacy mode

**Reporting Methods:**

5. **`getTotalQuoted($period)`** - Dashboard statistics
   - Supports periods: all time, month, last_month, year, last_year
   - Sums quote_total from quote_amounts
   - Filters by quote_date_created in ip_quotes table
   - **Impact:** Powers dashboard "Total Quoted" widgets

6. **`getStatusTotals($period)`** - Detailed status breakdown
   - Supports periods: this-month, last-month, this-quarter, last-quarter, this-year, last-year
   - Groups by quote_status_id
   - Returns sum of totals and count for each status
   - Merges with status definitions from Quote::statuses()
   - **Impact:** Powers dashboard status breakdowns and reports

**Critical Database Schema Understanding:**

The model handles two key tables:

**ip_quote_amounts:**
- quote_amount_id (PK)
- quote_id (FK)
- quote_item_subtotal - SUM of all item subtotals
- quote_item_tax_total - SUM of all item taxes
- quote_tax_total - SUM of quote-level taxes (legacy mode only)
- quote_total - Final total after all calculations

**ip_quote_item_amounts:**
- item_amount_id (PK)
- item_id (FK)
- item_subtotal - quantity × price
- item_tax_total - item_subtotal × tax_rate_percent
- item_discount - item-level discount
- item_total - item_subtotal + item_tax_total

**Calculation Flow:**

1. Items are saved → QuoteItemAmount::calculate() updates item_amounts
2. Any item change triggers QuoteAmount::calculate()
3. QuoteAmount::calculate() aggregates all item amounts
4. Applies global/quote-level discounts based on mode
5. Calls calculateQuoteTaxes() which updates tax rates
6. Final quote_total is stored in quote_amounts table

**Why This Is Critical:**

- Quote totals must be 100% accurate (money involved!)
- Must support both legacy and new calculation modes
- Must handle complex discount scenarios
- Must properly calculate and apply taxes
- Used throughout the system for displaying amounts
- Used in reporting and analytics
- Affects invoice conversion (quotes become invoices)

## Migration Methodology Established

### Conversion Patterns Documented

**1. Database Queries:**
```php
// OLD (CodeIgniter)
$this->db->where('quote_id', $id);
$this->db->update('ip_quotes', ['status' => 2]);

// NEW (Eloquent)
Quote::where('quote_id', $id)->update(['status' => 2]);
```

**2. Model Loading:**
```php
// OLD
$this->load->model('quotes/mdl_quotes');
$quote = $this->mdl_quotes->get_by_id($id);

// NEW
$quote = Quote::findOrFail($id);
```

**3. Complex Queries with Aggregation:**
```php
// OLD
$query = $this->db->query('
    SELECT SUM(quote_total) AS total
    FROM ip_quote_amounts
    WHERE quote_id IN (
        SELECT quote_id FROM ip_quotes
        WHERE MONTH(quote_date_created) = MONTH(NOW())
    )
');

// NEW
$total = QuoteAmount::whereIn('quote_id', function($query) {
    $query->select('quote_id')
        ->from('ip_quotes')
        ->whereRaw('MONTH(quote_date_created) = MONTH(NOW())');
})->sum('quote_total');
```

**4. Static Utility Methods:**
```php
// OLD (Instance method)
public function get_url_key() {
    return random_string('alnum', 32);
}

// NEW (Static method)
public static function getUrlKey(): string {
    return bin2hex(random_bytes(16));
}
```

**Issue:** Ensuring one-to-one migration without missing methods
**Solution:** Used grep to count methods, compared source to target, documented gaps

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Continuation

1. **Complete Quotes Module First**
   - Only 4 methods remaining
   - Will provide fully functional quote system
   - Can be tested end-to-end

2. **Then Invoice Module**
   - Mirrors quote structure
   - Can reuse patterns from quotes
   - Most critical for business

3. **Then Core Entities**
   - Client, Payment, Product critical for operations
   - Needed by other modules

### For Long-term Success

1. **Maintain One-to-One Migration**
   - Every method must be migrated
   - No simplification or shortcuts
   - Critical for calculations

2. **Test Calculations Thoroughly**
   - Quote totals must match legacy
